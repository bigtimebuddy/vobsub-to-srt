1
00:00:01,768 --> 00:00:04,703
Okay, here's
the situation.

2
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:07,399
Your parents went away
on a week's vacation.

3
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:09,704
They left the keys to
the brand new Porsche.

4
00:00:09,776 --> 00:00:12,870
Would they mind?
Well, of course not.

5
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:14,743
(SINGING) /'/ just take
it for a little spin

6
00:00:14,815 --> 00:00:17,875
And maybe show it
off to a couple of friends

7
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:21,409
TH just cruise
around the neighborhood
Well, maybe | shouldn't

8
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:25,015
Yeah! Of course | should
Pay attention, here's
the thick of the plot

9
00:00:25,092 --> 00:00:27,424
Pulled up to the corner
at the end of my block

10
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:29,928
That's when |
saw this beautiful
girly-girl walking

11
00:00:29,997 --> 00:00:33,694
! picked up my car phone
To perpetrate
like | was talking

12
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:38,128
Sunroof was open,
the music was high

13
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:40,571
And that girls
hand was steadily
moving up my thigh

14
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:42,939
She had opened
up three buttons
on her shirt so far

15
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,535
! guess that's why
! didn't notice
that police car

16
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:47,739
l can't believe it!
l made a mistake

17
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:50,510
But parents are the same
No matter time nor place

18
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:52,882
So to all you
kids all across the land

19
00:00:52,953 --> 00:00:55,922
No need to argue
Parents just
don't understand

20
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:57,013
JERRY: Yeah!
DONNA: AlI right!

21
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,148
(BOTH APPLAUDING)

22
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:00,022
Thank you. Thank you.

23
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:03,821
Just a little
something | know.
So, what's up?

24
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,956
Someone is on
fire in Ramsett Park.

25
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:08,058
They need you to get
down there right away.

26
00:01:08,702 --> 00:01:10,260
Oh, my God.

27
00:01:30,857 --> 00:01:33,121
l've been spending
the summer doing
a lot of zoo promotions.

28
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,155
(SINGING) For he's
a jolly good fellow...

29
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:36,991
Parrots live
a very long time.

30
00:01:37,064 --> 00:01:40,192
So we had a birthday party
for a parrot that turned 60.

31
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:42,462
(SINGING) ...which
nobody can deny

32
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:49,264
Chimpanzees are very
smart, so we had them
graduate from college.

33
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:51,368
And they like to fling
their feces, so we were

34
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:52,571
hoping that they
would fling their hats.

35
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:54,705
But they just
flung their feces.

36
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:56,307
(SCREECHING)

37
00:01:56,383 --> 00:01:57,907
The Pawnee Zoo
recently purchased

38
00:01:57,985 --> 00:02:00,954
two South African
black-footed penguins,
Tux and Flipper.

39
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:02,989
And as part of our
zoo promotion,

40
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:05,650
we are going to give them
a marriage ceremony,

41
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:08,391
because they
mate for life.

42
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,825
Tux, do you take
Flipper, to be your
lawfully wedded wife?

43
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:17,534
ldo! | do!

44
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:19,872
By the power
vested in me from

45
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:21,941
the Department of
Parks and Recreation,

46
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:24,409
l now pronounce
you husband and wife!

47
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:28,846
(WEDDING MARCH PLAYING)

48
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:33,243
Oh!

49
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,556
Okay, well,
at least they're married.

50
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,650
Are they making babies?

51
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:43,457
Well, not those two.
Those are both boy penguins.

52
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:45,391
l'm sorry?

53
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:47,330
Tux and Flipper
are both boys.

54
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:48,800
So you should
have pronounced them

55
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:50,632
husband and husband,
technically.

56
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:52,228
That's awesome.

57
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,408
Still, you couldn't
have asked for
better weather.

58
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:01,277
Brendanawicz,
you big sandwich eater.

59
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:02,440
Oh...

60
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,279
Cut it out, now.

61
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,842
Just to be clear,
that was a friend punch.

62
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,888
There was
no flirtatious
meaning behind

63
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:10,855
that playful punch |
just gave your arm.

64
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:13,654
Yes, | do understand.
You've made it
abundantly clear

65
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:14,955
that there's no
romantic element

66
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,290
to our relationship
in any way.

67
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:18,888
Yes. Good. Isn't it
good to be able to just

68
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:20,830
kind of horse around
like this as friends?

69
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:22,163
It is. Yeah.
Yeah.

70
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:24,032
l really hit rock
bottom that night.

71
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:26,672
And l mean that
1 literally fell

72
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,935
to the bottom of
a pit and hit a rock.

73
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:31,640
l remember
laying there thinking,

74
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:35,341
"There's probably a good
reason why l'm down
here and single."

75
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,844
And then | started thinking,
"| need morphine."

76
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:44,519
Oh, yeah, | hear you made
two male penguins
very happy today.

77
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:46,252
You're making history,
Knope. | like that.

78
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:47,384
Sticking your
neck out, you know.

79
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:49,292
No, | didn't stick
my neck out. It was
an accident.

80
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:50,488
Out of the mainstream.
l think that's cool.

81
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,790
l'm in the mainstream.

82
00:03:51,865 --> 00:03:53,526
Yeah, | know.
No, no. Not out of it.

83
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,091
Social activism.
No! Uh-uh.

84
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:57,431
People in this
town don't really like

85
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:59,438
their government
employees being activists.

86
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,974
Last year, a garbage
man was suspended

87
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:03,873
for wearing
a Live Strong bracelet.

88
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:08,008
Hey, Leslie, some guy
Who owns a gay bar
sent you a cake.

89
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,480
Pawnee has a gay bar?

90
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:11,449
Yeah.
The Bulge.

91
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:14,611
It's behind my house.

92
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:16,178
The Bulge is a gay bar?

93
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:18,691
Uh, the nights
l've wasted there.

94
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,660
"Leslie! Hey,
girrrrrrrrl!"

95
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:23,159
With eight R's.

96
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,564
"Thank you for supporting
the cause of gay marriage.

97
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:28,032
"You rock!
The boys at The Bulge."

98
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:30,602
They thought that was
a political gesture?

99
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,298
Okay, nobody eat that cake.
Tom? Step into my office.

100
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:35,204
That's also my office.
Yeah, whatever.

101
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,209
l know that you are not gay.
No, l'm not.

102
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,938
But you're effeminate.
What?

103
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:41,640
Well, you're wearing
a peach shirt with
a coiled snake on it.

104
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:45,344
Yes, 'cause it was featured
in Details magazine.
And it's awesome.

105
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:47,545
Effeminate.
Anyway, so the point is,

106
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:51,113
do you think that
marrying penguins
made some kind of statement?

107
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:54,854
Yes. The statement was
that you're very lonely
and you need a pet.

108
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:56,153
Huh.

109
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:57,628
Leslie? They sent
you T-shirts, too.

110
00:04:57,697 --> 00:04:59,858
Oh! Wow, look, they
sentus a T-shirt.

111
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:02,392
Hmm...

112
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,037
Mine has a collaron it.

113
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:08,267
There she is.
Leslie!

114
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:09,672
Hey!
Hey.

115
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,006
This is my boyfriend,
Derek, and this is
Derek's boyfriend, Ben.

116
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,273
Ä¤i.
Hey.

117
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:17,406
Oh! Wait, sorry,
what's the situation?

118
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:18,781
What do you mean?

119
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,449
Derek is gay,
but he's straight for me,

120
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:24,615
but he's gay
for Ben, and Ben's
really gay for Derek.

121
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:25,851
And | hate Ben.

122
00:05:25,926 --> 00:05:27,416
It's not that complicated.
No.

123
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,223
Oh. Yeah. Sure.

124
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:33,092
The thing about
youth culture is,
l don't understand it.

125
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,260
So what can |
do for you guys?

126
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,098
They just really
wanted to meet you,

127
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,570
because you're kind
of like their hero now.

128
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:43,973
Oh, oh, April, please,
it was just penguins.
APRIL: No!

129
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:47,013
l'm a public servant,
and l'm not allowed
to take a political stance.

130
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,207
But you did,
and it was awesome.

131
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:51,182
Yeah. None of the other
politicians ever
take a stand,

132
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:53,719
and it means a lot to
the whole gay community.

133
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:57,689
It does, and we're
gonna have this party
tomorrow night at The Bulge,

134
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,588
and we had
something to ask you.

135
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,557
We really want you to
be the guest of honor.

136
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:03,087
Oh, my.

137
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:04,357
Itd be amazing
if you came.

138
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:05,955
Yeah, you have to come.

139
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,294
Who made this?

140
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,493
We did.
Yeah, we did.

141
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:09,762
How?
Photoshop.

142
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:11,394
What? Oh!
Computers.

143
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,843
Hey, why are you
all dolled up?

144
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:20,744
It's a long story.
l'm the guest of honor
at this gay bar tonight.

145
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:23,878
l guess gay men are
starting to like me.

146
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,851
l don't know.
l guess they think
l'm fabulous or something.

147
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,912
Well, you look good, girl.
You're gonna turn
somebody tonight.

(LAÅ¬GHING)

149
00:06:34,928 --> 00:06:38,159
That was hands-down
the best interaction
l've ever had with Donna.

150
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:42,400
Leslie, this is
Marcia Langman from

151
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:45,927
the Society For Family
Stability Foundation.

152
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,834
Oh, hello.
| love your top.

153
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,307
Oh, thank you so much.

154
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:50,604
l was just hoping
you had a moment

155
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:52,668
to discuss the events
at the zoo yesterday.

156
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,078
Well, | have nothing
to do with this, so...

157
00:06:55,882 --> 00:07:01,218
Well, what can | do for
you and those fine
people at the SFSF?

158
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:05,515
Well, you could resign,
if you're up for it.

159
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,352
Oh, you're serious?

160
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,864
When you performed a marriage
for gay penguins,

161
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:14,730
using taxpayer money
on government property,

162
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:16,962
you were symbolically
taking a stand

163
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:19,403
in favor of
the gay marriage agenda.

164
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:22,675
Oh, l'm sorry, but hold on
a second there, Marcia.

165
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:25,006
That was not my
intention, at all.

166
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:27,409
Well, why else would
you marry penguins?

167
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:31,943
Because | firmly believed
that it would be cute.
And it was.

168
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:33,545
Leslie, are you married?

169
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,748
No. Not yet, Marcia.

170
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:40,850
Soon, probably.
l have a plan,
but, no, not now.

171
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:42,861
Not dating anyone yet.

172
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:44,123
Focusing on my career.

173
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:45,523
l thought so.

174
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:50,032
So you couldn't
possibly understand,
but when gays marry,

175
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:53,072
it ruins marriage
for the rest of us.

176
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,266
So, either you
annul the wedding,

177
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:57,902
or l'll publicly ask
for your resignation.

178
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:02,240
You know what?
l'm so terrible
with directions.

179
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,612
If l'm headed to
the parking lot,

180
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:05,048
do | make a left
out of here,
or do | go right?

181
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:06,710
It's a left, yeah.
Thank you.

182
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:08,378
You're welcome.
Annul the wedding!

184
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:16,724
Hey.
Hi!

185
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:21,256
l'm supposed to
meet Leslie for lunch,
but she actually works, so...

186
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:22,726
Ouch!

187
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:25,566
ANN: Mark was brought to
my hospital the night
of the accident.

188
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:27,003
He was here for a week.

189
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:29,268
! think when his
head hit the ground,

190
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,003
it mustve knocked
something loose,

191
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:34,012
because he's actually
a pretty nice guy now.

192
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:37,716
And Andy, after we
broke up, he told me

193
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:41,083
he was going to Kansas
to climb mountains.

194
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:46,016
So, | don't really
know where he is.

195
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,657
Hey, have you seen
that documentary
about food yet?

196
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:52,095
No, | haven't.
But | heard it's really
good. | want to see it.

197
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:53,632
We should go together.

198
00:08:54,701 --> 00:09:00,037
What? Yeah, no. | don't
think so. That would
be like a date.

199
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:02,641
Okay. Say no more.

200
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,135
Mmm.

201
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:06,570
l hate salad.

202
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:10,275
Leslie, | don't
want to ever keep
secrets from you.

203
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,215
Oh, me, neither.
Look, let's invent our own

204
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:13,752
secret language that
only we understand.

205
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,946
And then we can use
it around people

206
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:16,511
and no one will know what
we're talking about.

207
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:18,422
Okay.
Okay.

208
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:22,222
But in the meantime,
l'm just gonna
tell you in English.

209
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:24,354
Mark kind of
asked me out.

210
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:28,692
He weirdly asked me
to go see a movie with him,

211
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,998
and | said no,
of course, but | just...

212
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:33,233
l just wanted
to let you know.

213
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,374
l'm feeling a lot
of confusing things
right now.

214
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:40,709
Yeah. No, of course you are.

215
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,749
And your friendship
is the most important
thing to me.

216
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:46,445
And he's off-limits.

217
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,423
Thank you. | just want
to let you know, | was
really serious

218
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:54,983
about that secret language.

220

this is a gay bar.

with that heterosexual

us on the way in.

Where should | drink now?

224
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,367
There's a bar on
Eighth Street called
Pitchers and Catchers.

225
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,497
You can go there.

226
00:10:07,574 --> 00:10:09,633
Yeah. Hey!
Okay, listen.
Here's the plan.

227
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,700
Our position is,
we have no position.

228
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,507
So let's just say,
"Thank you for the party,

229
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:17,072
"but we regretfully decline
your offer to honor me."

230

| can't believe you came.

looking hot.

l'm really enjoying this hug.

tell you something.

to you for a second.

337
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:15,280
Sure, yeah.

338
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:23,718
JOAN: We have a controversial
topic today, the gay penguin
marriage at the Pawnee Zoo.

339
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:27,589
So, Marcia, what is
all the fuss about?

340
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,823
The fuss is that
Miss Knope claimed that

341
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:33,889
she was not
advocating for
this gay cause,

342
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:37,136
and then that very night,
she was the guest of honor

343
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:41,162
at a pro-gay marriage rally
at a bar called The Bulge.

344
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,174
Miss Knope,
how do you respond?

345
00:15:43,242 --> 00:15:46,370
l'd first like to say
that | wasn't trying to
advocate for anyone.

346
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:49,381
l did not know that
both of the penguins
were males,

347
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,679
and | was just trying
to perform a cute,

348
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:54,345
fun ceremony to
promote our local zoo.

349
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:57,617
| have to say that
that stunt that you did

350
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:00,124
with the penguins was
clearly over the line.

351
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:05,062
Now, Marcia, what, if
anything, can Miss Knope
do to make it right?

352
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:08,934
Joan, we don't want
to be unreasonable.
Of course not.

353
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:13,768
We think that she should
separate the penguins,
annul the marriage,

354
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:18,004
reimburse the taxpayers
for the cost of the wedding,
of course,

355
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:19,806
and then resign.

356
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:21,005
Oh! ls that it?

357
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,172
That would do it.

358
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:24,512
Anything else?
You want me to
jump off a building?

359
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:27,678
Perform hara-kiri?
Move to a different town?
No, | kid.

360
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:29,685
Full of ideas here today.

361
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:32,315
This is the reason
why people don't
go into politics.

362
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,894
Because, | bust my ass
for the people in this city,
and | can't win.

363
00:16:35,962 --> 00:16:40,763
l have one night of fun
with some of the best dancers
l've ever danced with,

364
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,630
and suddenly everybody's
freaking out?

365
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:44,602
Wow, look at that!
Wow, we're lighting up here.

366
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,035
Great. Let's go for it.
Bring it on.

367
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:47,436
l've never seen that
on our show before.

368
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:48,531
How does this work?

369
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:49,597
Well, there...
Push that, and...

370
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,006
Great. Okay. Hey!
You're on the air!

371
00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:52,374
You're on the air! Good!

372
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:54,276
CALLER 1: Yeah, l think that
lady should resign.

373
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,645
Okay, good.
Thank you. Next caller.

374
00:16:56,716 --> 00:16:59,310
CALLER 1: You should resign
and repay your salary.

375
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:02,183
Okay, two for resign.
Thank you. Next caller.

376
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:06,021
CALLER 2: / just want to
say that I love the zoo,
and the zoo is really fun.

377
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:09,492
Thank you.
That's really sweet.

378
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:11,393
And l think you
should resign.

379
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,065
You look great.
You look amazing.

380
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:18,729
Thanks. You look fancy.

381
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,833
Oh, yeah, the monkey suit.
Cost 3,000 bucks,

382
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:24,468
but totally worth it.
l sold out!

383
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:27,769
l got a boring
office job in town, so...

384
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:31,442
l gotta dress up,
you know, the grind.
But l'm really happy,

385
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:34,816
and | really feel
like l've matured a lot.

386
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:38,586
Good! That's...
l'm happy for you.
Yeah.

387
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:41,149
So listen, | was
sitting in the cubicle
the other day,

388
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:42,660
just doing some thinking,

389
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:43,820
and some growing...

390
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,158
And some maturing.

391
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:51,066
(CHUCKLES) Yes! Maturing.
And darn itif l don't
just miss you, and...

392
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:54,770
Andy.
Well, A-Cakes, just let me...

393
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:57,835
l love you,

394
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,003
and l'm just really
sorry for the way
that | treated you.

395
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,014
l was the worst
boyfriend ever,
l know that,

396
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:07,041
and | really think
it would behoove us
to give it another shot.

397
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:11,885
Yeah, look.
l'm really happy for
you about your job

398
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:13,791
and that you've
learned some new words,

399
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:16,453
but l'm sure
about my decision.

400
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:21,263
Okay. Say no more.

401
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:24,633
ANDY: Listen, hit me up
on my cell phone.
lH be around.

402
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:28,534
And if you wanna talk,
or grab coffee or
something like that.

403
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,166
Okay?
ANN: Okay.

404
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:33,177
Oh. Gotta get back
to the office.
Have a good one.

405
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:35,110
Good seeing you.
Bye.

406
00:18:48,928 --> 00:18:51,396
And the hardest part
about living in this pit

407
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,898
is probably keeping
my suit pressed.

408
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:02,707
And the rats.
It's like a freaking
rat parade every night.

409
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:04,773
l just want to be
close to her house,

410
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:06,436
because | need
to protect her.

411
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:10,179
"Cause there are
some weird people
that live around here.

412
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:13,281
CALLER 3: Yeah, if you let
penguins get married,
where does it end?

413
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:15,980
! mean, would you let me
marry my guinea pig?

414
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:18,285
Because | really do
want to marry my guinea pig.

415
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:20,018
TI take my answer
off the air.

416
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:21,218
l think that's
a valuable point.

417
00:19:21,293 --> 00:19:24,888
Attendance is up 3090
at the zoo, by the way.
You're welcome.

418
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:28,297
That penguin wedding was
cute, damn it. And l'm
not gonna annul it.

419
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:29,664
l'd ask you to reconsider.

420
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:32,670
Well, l'd ask you
to stop asking me,

421
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:34,899
because it's not
gonna happen, Marcia.

422
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:36,066
Is that right?

423
00:19:36,142 --> 00:19:39,339
Last time | checked,
l don't think l
murdered anyone,

424
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:42,313
or had an affair,
or did drugs!

425
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:45,782
But | apologize.
l apologize for having fun,

426
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,250
and for making
something cute!

427
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:51,252
Where are you
from originally?

428
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:53,223
Oh, no!
What did | do?

429
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:56,592
So, you will not be
annulling the marriage?

430
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:59,722
No. | will not
be annulling. No.

431
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:09,068
Look at them. They're just
in their own little
penguin love bubble.

432
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:12,936
l guess that's what it's like
when you meet your mate

433
00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:15,845
and know you're gonna
be together forever.

434
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:18,906
(DOORBELL RINGING)

435
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:20,743
Hi!
Hi!

436
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,082
You know what | realized?
What?

437
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:25,351
We're just animals.
We don't know
anything about love.

438
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:26,550
Okay.
Yeah.

439
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,388
l think you should go
on that date with Mark.

440
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:29,519
Oh, Leslie...

441
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:31,062
Really, seriously.
| thought about it,

442
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:35,089
and, look, he might
not be my gay penguin,
but he could be yours.

443
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:37,397
Look, | told you
l'm not going on
a date with him.

444
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,904
Okay, fine. If you don't
want to go out with him,
don't go out with him.

445
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:41,633
But don't not do
it because of me,

446
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:43,402
because l'm
really fine with it.

447
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:46,273
All that's important to me
is that we're still friends.

448
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:47,972
Me, too!
Good! Great.

449
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:52,680
Plus, l already called him
and told him that

450
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,481
you were dying to go out
with him, so have fun.

451
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,012
Huh?

452
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:01,785
So, | transferred
the penguins to
a zoo in lowa.

453
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:04,762
Gay marriage is legal there,
so hopefully,
they'll be happy.

454
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,025
At least they'll be together.

455
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:14,634
Oh, look! Six Flags!
l should take them
on a water slide.

456
00:21:14,707 --> 00:21:17,335
They might die.
But it would be so cute!
